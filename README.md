# DigitalMarketing
Repository for Project 2 of CMPG 323. Programming a photo sharing site for a digital marketing company.

# Executive Summary
A South African digital marketing company has expressed the need for a web application that serves
as an online platform allowing users to store, view and share photos. Users should be able to create an
account and login before utilising the platform. Once logged in, users should be able to view their own
photos as well as the photos shared with them. The user should be able to create and manage the
metadata recorded for each photo that the user has access to. The ability to share content with other
registered users also needs to be built into the web application. Users should have the ability to
download photos that they have access to. The web application should be designed as consistent,
intuitive, easy-to-use and easy-to-navigate without needing to provide excessive user guide
documentation. All information and media items that are stored should be stored securely and in
accordance with POPI.
